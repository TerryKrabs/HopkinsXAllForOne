### All For One

### Summary - I used Async Functions to fetch the data from my previous Mini Challenges. It was a struggle to get my footing on this assignment, but once I got the hang of Tailwind, and fetching from Azure, the assignment pretty much just became copy and paste from there. I added 2 Easter Eggs, too help compensate for the asignment being turned in so late. The easter eggs can be found by Not letting your dreams be dreams!!!

### Peer Review by - Bria Harrold
Everything works smooth I like how you have a gif in your navbar. I also really like the color palette and consistency of the input fields in the same place. Overall I thing some data vaildation is missing on some the pages other that that great job.
